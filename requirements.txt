Ensure you have a requirements.txt file in the same directory with the following content:

numpy
pyaudio
pygame
scipy

Run the Python script:

bash

    python install_requirements.py

This script will check each required library, and if any are missing, it will try to install them automatically. If installation fails, it will suggest looking at the requirements.txt for manual installation instructions.
