# Pygame EQ Visualizer
## Overview
**Pygame EQ Visualizer** is a real-time audio visualizer built using 
Python and Pygame. It captures audio input and generates a dynamic 
visual representation of the sound frequencies, similar to an 
equalizer display. This project demonstrates how you can use Pygame 
for more than just game development, providing a fun and interactive 
way to visualize audio data.
## Features
- **Real-Time Audio Processing**: Visualizes frequencies from live 
audio input or audio files. - **Customizable Display**: Change 
colors, bar sizes, animation speed, and more. - **Simple and 
Lightweight**: Ideal for beginners learning audio processing and 
Pygame.
  
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need: - **Python 3.x** - **Pygame** 
installed (`pip install pygame`) - **PyAudio** for real-time audio 
input (`pip install pyaudio`)
### Installation
1. Clone this repository: bash git clone 
   https://github.com/onojk/pygame-eq-visualizer.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: ```bash cd pygame-eq-visualizer 
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies: ```bash pip install -r 
   requirements.txt ```
### Running the Visualizer
1. Make sure your microphone or audio input device is connected. 2. 
Run the visualizer:
   ```bash python visualizer.py ``` By default, the visualizer will 
capture the system's audio input and display the frequency spectrum 
in real time. If you want to visualize a specific audio file, you can 
modify the input source within the script.
## Customization
You can tweak the following settings within the code: - **Bar 
Colors**: Change the color of the equalizer bars for a personalized 
look. - **Bar Size**: Modify the height and width of the bars to your 
preference. - **Animation Speed**: Adjust the speed at which the bars 
react to audio input.
  
## Target Audience
- Python developers who want to learn about real-time audio 
processing. - Developers interested in experimenting with Pygame for 
non-game applications. - Anyone looking to create their own audio 
visualizer for personal or educational purposes.
## Comparison
Compared to other audio visualizers, this project is: - **Lightweight 
and Easy-to-Use**: Simple enough for beginners without requiring 
advanced audio processing libraries like OpenGL or external DSP 
tools. - **Pygame-Centric**: Built entirely using Pygame, offering a 
great learning opportunity for those familiar with the library.
